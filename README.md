# Password-Strength-Detector

* Flask (Python web development framework) used for webpages.
* SVM (Support Vector Machines) used for training and classification purposes.
* Self-generated data set of 50000 instances

Steps:
1. First make sure you have flask installed, if not enter the following command in terminal:
`pip install Flask`.
2. Next, you need `scikit-learn`, which is a data mining tool in Python. Install it by typing:
`pip install -U scikit-learn`. 
3. After installing flask, extract the contents in a folder and then run the `__init__.py` file.
4.  Server runs at `localhost:5000`, type this address in the browser and see the SVM in action.
